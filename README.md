## Companion for HorizonXI wiki

Ashita v4 plugin that allows you to search for things on the HorizonXI wiki with context-sensitive commands.

`/wiki item` to search for currently hovered item

`/wiki target` to look up the current target

`/wiki [your search term]` for a generic search

I recommend you bind the first two to a hotkey [using Ashita](https://docs.ashitaxi.com/usage/commands/#command-bind)
